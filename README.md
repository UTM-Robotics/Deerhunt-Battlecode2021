# Battlecode Deerhunt 2021 Game

## What is Battlecode?

[Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/) is an AI competition that uniquely challenges partipants to combine game strategy, programming, and artificial intelligence. Although the game theme and rules change year-to-year, Battlecode remains a turn-based strategy game where 2 teams of virtual robots face off with only 1 team emerging as the winner.

Battlecode is MIT's longest running (20+ years) programming competition. It typically spans about 22 days and partipants can work either alone or on a team. The competition welcomes everyone from beginner programmers to advanced programmers. Participants often incorporate knowledge of artificial intelligence, pathfinding, distributed alogorithms and/or networking communications when developing their player program. Learn something new in those 22 days? No problem! Players are able to test and refine their AIs as the competition goes on.

Previous final competitions hosted by MIT can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOrfTSnyimIXfYzI8j_-CTQ).

## Motivation

We want to challenge UTM students to program their own AI robots. The competition is also open to all levels of programming experience.


# Battlecode: Merlin
In this year's game, play as a wizard while at war with another wizard. In this war, the wizards do not fight themselves, they instead fight by controlling their armies to capture the opposing wizard's flag, or bring him to submission by crushing his army.
